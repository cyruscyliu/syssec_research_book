# Crisis in Prosperity: Internal Shortcuts and External Setbacks

**Academic prosperity?** On the surface, cybersecurity research looks thriving: more funding, more students, more papers. But this “prosperity” is driven by multiple forces—rising security budgets, growing student cohorts, top-tier conference orientation, team-based production, and the widespread use of large-model tools. These forces accelerate output, yet they also push peer review and mentorship to the edge. Reviewer pools are larger, but reviewer time is spread thin, submissions keep rising, and people are too busy to review deeply. Effective review cycles keep shrinking. At the same time, supervision is diluted by volume, and many advisors cannot or choose not to provide meaningful guidance.

**Shortcuts undermine fairness.** From ghostwriting and ghost-submission to collusion in peer review, shortcuts erode trust-based review. Initiatives like ACM Protect aim to restore fairness by removing unfair advantages rather than only punishing outright fraud, which gives rule-followers a sense of justice. But the side effects are real: some professors may fail performance evaluations, students may be unable to graduate, faculty with blemished records can become targets of political manipulation, and pre-screening can misfire—such as flagging a valid citation as missing. Reputational damage then compounds the anxiety, especially for already vulnerable communities.

**Scientists have a motherland, and science has national borders.** In an increasingly interconnected world, geopolitics shapes how research is perceived, funded, and shared. The ideal of borderless knowledge persists, yet political dynamics influence collaboration, discussion, and talent mobility. When national interests intersect with research, evaluation and dissemination are pulled by non-research forces, and neutrality becomes harder to sustain.

**From papers to practice.** In this environment, chasing “more papers” is the wrong target. What we need is deeper translation. Staying with a direction and turning research into usable, reusable, and scalable practice mobilizes more social resources and creates greater social value. Top-tier papers matter, but the true impact comes from systems that can be deployed, maintained, and improved in the real world. The conclusion is simple: stop fixating on publishing; focus on real-world application.
