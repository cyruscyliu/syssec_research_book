# A Journey to System Security

Welcome to **A Journey to System Security** — a comprehensive guide to system security research methods and practice.

## About This Book

System security focuses on the relationship between attackers, vulnerabilities, and assets, and protects critical assets by discovering and fixing flaws while building effective defenses. Its characteristics can be summarized as foundational, systemic, and cross-layer. This book centers on the methods and practices that move system security research forward.

## What You'll Learn

This book is organized into ten parts, each focusing on a critical aspect of system security research:

1. **[System Security Research Survival Guide](p1-why-system-security.md)** — Understanding the motivation and challenges of the field
2. **[System Security Research Methodology](p2-Research-Philosophy.md)** — How to conduct system security research
3. **[How to Find Related Work](p3-literature-review.md)** — Navigating the research landscape
4. **[Building a Research Knowledge Base](p4-knowledge-for-research.md)** — Essential knowledge foundations
5. **[Engineering for System Security Research](p5-Summary-Research-SE.md)** — Bridging theory and implementation
6. **[Research Presentation and Talks](p6-research-presentation.md)** — Presenting and communicating your work effectively
7. **[Technology Transfer and Practical Deployment](p7-technology-transfer.md)** — From research to real-world impact
8. **[Pitfalls, Adjustments, and Tips in R&D](p8-dont-waste-time.md)** — Productivity and time management
9. **[Research Groups and Lab Management](p9-research-groups.md)** — Collaborative research dynamics
10. **[Crisis in Prosperity: Internal Shortcuts and External Setbacks](p10-properity-of-crisis.md)** — Finding opportunities in challenges
